-- SimpleNotepad app version 1.0 --  
App: create note and save it  

<br>

added feature:  
  - new button click event to main activity to create new note
  - In design view:  
       > FloatingActionButton object   
       > > id: createNoteBtn  
       > > position: left bottom with 16dp layout margin  
       > > icon: ic_input_add  
  - ActivityMain.java:  
       > Inside protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState):     
       > > editText to empty for new note  
       > > update filename Note(X+1).txt (X was current, X+1 for new file name)  
  ```
        FloatingActionButton createNoteBtn = findViewById(R.id.createNoteBtn);
        createNoteBtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                f_index += 1;
                fileName = "Note" + f_index + ".txt";
                editText1.setText(Open(fileName));
                d("kim", "new note created as " + fileName);
            }
        });
   ```
        
**Current problem in Version 1.0**  
working fine (I found one bug but anyway) as it is.  
file naming system has problem when item removed(deleted).    
current system: count number of saved file and give next digit for new file.  
if file removed then same filename can be given.  
But in Version 1.0, there is no implementaion of deleting an item.  
<br>

**Next step**  
1. change file naming system, not counting number of files instead get maximum id from the files based on the file name.    
2. add date(date of created/saved) information to the file name and display in View as a title.    
3. implement remove item
