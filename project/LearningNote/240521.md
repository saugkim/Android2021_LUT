<br>
**Things done**  
I have learned how to build app, release-apk  
in build.gradle(:app) set release apk name as "Note_R${variant.versionName}.apk"  
<br>
Build -> Generate Signed bundle or APK --> select APK (build a signed APK) -> Next  
      -> Key store path --> choose existing (alias as key0) -> Next  
      -> Destination folder --> Course/project/Build  
      -> Build Variants --> release  
      -> Signiture version --> V1 (jar Signiture) -> Finish  
<br>
Note_R1.0.apk was created in local repository project/Build/release/    
.gitignore contains Build directory, apk file uploaded in remote repository /project  
upload the apk file to google drive, get sharable link

**Things to do**  
testing

### Build app (general procedure)  
[ref developer.android](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/preparing)  
prepare for release: configure, build and test
  - create a release-ready package that users can install and run on their Android-powered devices
  - release-ready package contains compiled source code, resources, manifest file, and so on same as build-apk
  - release-ready APK file is signed with your own certificate  

1. Gathering materials and resources:  
   - Cryptographic keys: sign application with private key
   - application icon
   - prepare End-user license agreement (EULA)
    
2. Configuring Your application for release: 
   - select good package name, turn off logging debugging
   - clean up directory
   - review and update manifest and gradle build setting
    
3. Building Your application for release:   
   - build with android studio, use the Gradle build system
   - build a release-ready APK file that is signed with private key and optimized
    
4. Preparing external servers and resources: 
   - if app relies on a remote server, make sure the server is secure and that it is configured for production use.
    
5. Testing your application for release:
   - ensure that your application runs properly under realistic device and network conditions 
 

### Release app
release-apk uploaded in google drive it has shared link
also found here in project/Build folder  
can be uploaded store (google play or somewhere else)
