I have learned how to build app, release-apk  
### Build app (general procedure)
prepare for release: configure, build and test
  - create a release-ready package that users can install and run on their Android-powered devices
  - release-ready package contains compiled source code, resources, manifest file, and so on same as build-apk
  - release-ready APK file is signed with your own certificate  

1. Gathering materials and resources:  
   - Cryptographic keys: sign application with private key
   - application icon
   - prepare End-user license agreement (EULA)
    
2. Configuring Your application for release: 
   - select good package name, turn off logging debugging
   - clean up directory
   - review and update manifest and gradle build setting
    
3. Building Your application for release:   
   - build with android studio, use the Gradle build system
   - build a release-ready APK file that is signed with private key and optimized
    
4. Preparing external servers and resources: 
   - if app relies on a remote server, make sure the server is secure and that it is configured for production use.
    
5. Testing your application for release:
   - ensure that your application runs properly under realistic device and network conditions
