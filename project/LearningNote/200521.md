reference: [Using the RecyclerView](https://guides.codepath.com/android/using-the-recyclerview)  
and https://www.androidauthority.com/lets-build-a-simple-text-editor-for-android-773774/

**Steps**  
1. create new project with basic activity  
    - default fragments removed

2. activity_main.xml includes content_main.xml and has toolbar and floating action button  
    - content_main.xml has one EditText design object to write something here  
    - EditText hint: Type here  

3. default floating action button(id: fab) used to save note    
    - internal storage with default location and file access by only this app
    - set fab property srcCompat: button icon with ic_menu_save  
    ```
    <com.google.android.material.floatingactionbutton.FloatingActionButton
        android:id="@+id/fab"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_gravity="bottom|end"
        android:layout_margin="@dimen/fab_margin"
        app:srcCompat="@android:drawable/ic_menu_save" />
     ```   
    - set on click event listener MainActivity.java/onCreate()
    ```
        FloatingActionButton fab = findViewById(R.id.fab);
        fab.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                d("kim", "saved file name is: " + fileName);
                save(fileName);
            }
        });
    ```
    - implement file saving and loading (open)  


4. create new activity to show list of created/saved notes  
    - basic acitivity of NoteSelectActivity with one floating action button(fab)  
    - Note select activity has RecyclerView (similar to ListView)  
    - this fab create new note in MainActivity  
    - set icon in fab with ic_menu_edit  
    - item(note) click in RecyclerView shows content of the selected note in MainActivity
    
5. create java class Note to build note object
    - Note class has two string attributes, title and content
    - constructor with parameters and getters
    - title holds file name of the note (automatic system not by user)
    - content holds content of the note (user's content)

6. create new layout to display each note in RecyclerView   
    - LinearLayout   
    - two EditText design objects for title and content of the note  
    - show title on top as bold  
    - show content right below title  

7. create adapter class NoteAdapter  
    - adaptor takes a data set and attaches it to the recycler view    
    - it has array list of created note object (mNotes)  
    - title and content of the note is shown via RecyclerView.ViewHolder  
          -- onCreateViewHolder() and onBindViewHolder()


### RecyclerView  

The RecyclerView is a successor of ListView and GridView. Compared to ListView,  RecyclerView provides the ability to implement both horizontal and vertical layouts and animation is easy to perform. Use the RecyclerView when data collections whose elements change at runtime based on user action.  

Components of RecyclerView  

    1. Layout Managers
        - A layout manager positions item views inside a RecyclerView and helps in positioning the items  
        - RecyclerView has built-in managers (LinearLayoutManager, Grid...)  
        - custom layout manager is possible extending RecyclerView.LayoutManager class  

    2. Adapter  
        - To handle the data collection and bind it to the view  
        - override two main methods:  
            one to inflate the view and its view holder 
            another one to bind data to the view
           
    3. Item Animator  
        - RecyclerView.ItemAnimator will animate ViewGroup modifications such as add/delete/select that are notified to the adapter.

How to use RecyclerView  

    1. Define a model class to use as the data source       --> Note.java
    
    2. Add a RecyclerView to activity to display the items  --> activity_note_select.xml
    
    3. Create a custom layout XML file to visualize the item  --> notelist.xml  
    
    4. Create a RecyclerView.Adapter and ViewHolder to render the item  --> NoteAdapter.java
    
    5. Bind the adapter to the data source to populate the RecyclerView  --> NoteSelectActivity.java

    6. Notifying the Adapter  --> implemented later!! 
        - notifyItemChanged(int pos)	Notify that item at the position has changed.
        - notifyItemInserted(int pos)	
        - notifyItemRemoved(int pos)	Notify that items previously located at the position have been removed from the data set.
        - notifyItemRangeChanged(int pos, List model)  
    
    7. Handling touch event
