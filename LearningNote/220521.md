**22 May (Sat)**  

-- SimpleNotepad app --  
Next two things are implemented
1. file naming system, not count number of files instead find maximum id from saved files based on the filename. Give next digit for new file name
2. file removing when long button click on selected item(note in my case).

**unsolved problem**  
after deleting item(note object from list and file), screen(view) not updated in recycle view.


**Next to do**  
solve above problem. update(refresh) RecyclerView after item removed
